# Dog Liker

## Overview

### This app is designed to randomly show you dog photos, and you will be able to like or dislike the photo. You will see the name of the breed, what the dog is bred for and what its temperament is, along with a photo of the dog.

## Features

### This app has 3 features:

#### 1: Show photos of dog breeds
#### 2: Allow you to like or dislike photos
#### 3: Give the name of the breed, what the dog is bred for and its temperament

## How to Use

### For each image, the breed name, what the dog is bred for and its temperament are listed. Simply decide if you like or dislike each dog, and choose the corresponding button. Hope you enjoy this little app -- maybe you will find a new dog breed to learn about or maybe you just like looking at pictures of dogs!
